# My Writing Repository
Joey's central repository for writing.
Fictional works here are my own, my academic assignments are hosted here for posterity and as a resource for future cadets, and recipes are adapted to suit my own tastes.

You can find my resume [here](https://github.com/averagejoey2000/resume).


This repository contains my writing assignments and other documents.
