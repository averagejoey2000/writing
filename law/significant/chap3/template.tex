``Negligence may be shown by evidence of a violation of a statute or regulation.'' \fullcitebib{schoenbaum_admiralty_2019} %you have to make a copy of the law.bib in your own directory and change the page number in the database

I am reminded of a practice introduced to me by a 3rd mate I worked under, Mr. Mike Thompson.
He was showing me the checklists and inspections that the ship’s crew had to complete, special care taken to his section.
I was no stranger to checklists, but he showed me how the standard practice is that all checklists have on them the reference to the CFRs that require such inspections be made.
We were looking at the monthly inventory of equipment for each of the lifeboats, and he showed me that the reference on the checklist matched the fact that the regulation requires this inspection to be made monthly.
That way, you can always double check that the schedule and the content are correct, but also so that in the event that something were to happen and they bring up a statute, you can search for the appropriate title and section in the ship’s computer and find evidence that the correct form has been completed regularly and completely, satisfying your duty, and proving that you are not negligent
