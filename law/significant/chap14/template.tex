``The subject of historic shipwrecks in the Area is addressed by UNCLOS Article 149: All objects of an archaeological and historical value found in the Area shall be preserved or disposed of for the benefit of mankind as a whole, particular regard being paid to the preferential rights of the State or country of origin, or the State of cultural origin, or the State of historical and archaeological origin.'' \fullcite{schoenbaum_admiralty_2019}

As an avid lover of sea shanties, \textit{Treasure Island}, and \textit{Assassin's Creed Black Flag}, it is a little disappointing to me that the ancient law of ``finders-keepers'' does not apply to what the UN decides are shipwrecks of historical significance.
Perhaps some distinction can be made that although the wreck of a sunken Spanish Galleon in international waters may be of archaeological value as a historical remnant of colonialism, the native gold in the hold is not, and can therefore be all mine.
