	abstract = {Integrating Explainable Artificial Intelligence ({XAI}) into marine cyberdefense systems can address the lack of trustworthiness and low interpretability inherent in complex black-box Network Intrusion Detection Systems ({NIDS}) models. {XAI} has emerged as a pivotal focus in achieving a zero-trust cybersecurity strategy within marine communication networks. This article presents the development of a zero-trust {NIDS} framework designed to detect contemporary marine cyberattacks, utilizing two modern datasets (2023 Edge-{IIoTset} and 2023 {CICIoT}). The zero-trust {NIDS} model achieves an optimal Matthews Correlation Coefficient ({MCC}) score of 97.33\% and an F1-score of 99\% in a multi-class experiment. The {XAI} approach leverages visual and quantitative {XAI} methods, specifically {SHapley} Additive {exPlanations} ({SHAP}) and the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations ({LIME}) algorithms, to enhance explainability and interpretability. The research results indicate that current black-box {NIDS} models deployed for marine cyberdefense can be made more reliable and interpretable, thereby improving the overall cybersecurity posture of marine organizations.},

This has been taken into account in recent years and the {IMO} has issued directives and circulars with recommendations for increasing the cybersecurity of ship information systems as part of the overall ship security system. The effect of a successful cyber-attack of any kind, on elements of the ship’s {IT} and {OT} systems, can have a disastrous impact not only on the ship itself but also on the environment. While modern ships can be designed and all modern methods implemented to reduce and prevent the possibility of cyber-attacks onboard existing ships, it is not possible to achieve this security level and it is necessary to implement various solutions. At the same time, the ships’ crew is declining worldwide and most ships do not have {IT} officers or trained staff onboard to maintain the ship’s information systems. Because of that, the solutions that need to be put in place to increase the security of ship’s information systems must be easy to implement, use, and maintain. This article examines the need and some technical solutions that can be used to improve the cybersecurity of ship’s {IT} and {OT} systems in response to the existing cyber-attacks and threats in the global shipping and maritime industry.},

Because of its mandate to secure U.S. maritime borders and ports, it has powers as a warfighting force, law-enforcement agency, regulator and member of the intelligence community.

Along with special agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Guardsmen boarded the ship—the first time the Coast Guard deployed its cyber protection team—bringing bagels and cream cheese for the crew.

Later that month, Capt. Tama spoke onstage at a conference hosted by the {FBI} and Fordham University to go over details of the case .

A list of cyberattack incidents in various industries are presented. By restricting our attention to the maritime industry, this research identifies three maritime cyber threats, including the lack of training and experts, the use of outdated system, the risk of being hacker's target. To deal with the identified threats, a number of mitigation strategies are also proposed in this study, including developing cyber security process, providing cybersecurity training course, updating and upgrading programme regularly, and fostering cybersecurity climate.},

	abstract = {The maritime industry with its main components--port logistics, ships, cargo and container distribution systems, autonomous control and navigation systems, global identification and navigation systems--is a substantial and plausible target of cyberattacks. The goal of the present study is to reveal and describe all components of the shipping industry's cybersecurity policy, the main types of cyberattacks, methods, means, and stages of implementation, cyber vulnerability assessment of on-board information and communication systems, as well as technological measures for cyber defence.
