Six Dollars. I came here to dispute an overdue charge on a book I swear
I returned. I have a lot to do today, and it was enough to drag my
daughter with me after church to translate for me, and we still have to
go to the store to get more maseca. Of course, right when the librarian
hands us the paperwork to fill out the official request to remove the
charge, and attest that I put it in the drop box last Sunday, the fire
alarm goes off. This blaring is giving me such a headache. As I walk out
of the lobby and into the courtyard, I push through a group of confused
Korean women in green blazers. That's weird. I pinch the bridge of my
nose, as sounds mix together; the alarm, the siren of an approaching
fire truck, and... people laughing and setting up a group photo? I cover
my granddaughter's ears at the cost of my own. There's not even any
smoke coming from the building, was it practice? I could come back on
Wednesday, but I have my doctor taking my blood, the fee will have gone
up to ten dollars, and my daughter is working so I have to take care of
the girl and I won't have a translator. I sit by the fountain, take an
aspirin from my purse, my phone from my bra, and make a call. Que
Carajo.

"Hi, is this where I sign up for a library card?"\
click click click

"Absolutely, have a seat. Photo ID?"

"Right Here, but it's from out of state"

"Did you just move here?"\
"Kinda, I actually go to school at Touro, I live in the dorm, and I
haven't changed my official residence."

"Do you have any mail addressed to you?"\
She's making this kinda difficult.

"No Yeah, I don't, but my school ID has the address on the back"\
"And this address is where we can send you mail?"\
"Actually, students have a mailroom box with a different address"\
Alright, we're at three addresses, 2 IDs, and one paper. I could've been
a border inspector

"Email address"

"\[redacted\]@\[forprivacy\]"

"Phone number?"

"I actually just changed companies, couldn't keep my number, I don't
have it memorized"\
Just entirely unprepared.

"Take your time sweetie"\
"Okay, \[redacted\]"

Finally\
"Last thing, just pick a picture for your card"\
"Space!"\
scan, click click

"Alrighty, here's your card, your pin is the last 4 digits of your phone
number, here's the terms of service and library rules"\
"Thanks"\
"was there anything else I could do for you?"\
"Could you show me the LGBT shelf?"\
Where did I see that?\
"I actually usually work at a different library, so I don't have the
layout memorized, but come with me and I'll get you pointed the right
way, just give me a seco-"\

Nevermind.

What a job this is. What is it I even do here? Keep people from stealing
\*free\* books? Keep people from being inside in the wrong way? It's
January, it's cold, why shouldn't people loiter here, it's cold out and
there's Wi-Fi. Hrrgnh, rounds sheet says that next, I check the bathroom
to make sure there's no one shaving, grooming, or otherwise
inappropriately using the facility. Official job description, "tell
people to go use the sink somewhere else". Kay, that's done, and this
time no naked old dude. Computer lab check, this one's important, last
week alone we had two pervs. Aight, job search, cat videos, language
software, and one college kid who looks like they haven't slept since
middle school scrolling research papers and looking at their phone. All
is well.

"Hi, Lucille"

"Hi"

I think she's reshelved that same volume 3 times today.

?

What's that guy doing? He's got no books, he's not on his phone, he's
just staring at the circulation desk. Has he been here since we opened?

Whatever.

I'm so bored, I w- \*BLAART BLAART BLAART\*

Holy shit, I'm a reality bender! I wish I had a million dollars!

Huh

"Proceed in an orderly fashion to the courtyard, take your belongings,
leave library materials, please remain calm"

\*BLAART BLAART BLAART\*

"Okay Everyone, this looks good for a group photo!"

May as well do this now, it's not like there's anything else to be doing
right now, and nobody is going to wander off. "How long until the FD
gets here to silence the alarm?"

"10 minutes?" Yeah, this will do.

Isn't it kinda weird to do a fire drill in the middle of a ceremony? The
mayor is here.

It's nice to see so many people come to these events though, not enough
people know about our sister cities. The lighting out here is great, the
weather's not too bad, the mayor is shaking hands with the Bagamoyo
delegation, let's get some snapshots. \*BLAART\* click \*BLAART\* click

"Looks great everyone"\
I also grab a shot of the catered cold cuts, and wrap one up for myself.
That Tanzanian woman is wearing a really nice gold pashmina. Click

Nice, she's talking to the Japanese saleswoman with the spray
disinfectors machines, that's neat!

"Do some advertising for me", I say, switching my camera to video mode,
to let her demo "the power of ionization", and letting her show off the
mini model she keeps in her purse.

A young man hands me and the other guests invitations to the Black
History Month, Black and White Gala, for the sister city society. Should
I wear a tuxedo? I'm not going to be in any of the pictures, I'll be on
this side of the camera.

There's the firefighter\
"Okay ladies and gentlemen, we're all clear"\
I take a bite of the sandwich, it's alright

What a fine day.
