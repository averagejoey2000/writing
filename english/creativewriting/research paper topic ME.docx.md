Paper Subject, Renewable Energy

The Boy Scouts instilled in me a love of nature and sustainability. I
also sail as a hobbyist, and aspire one day to complete a zero-carbon
circumnavigation of the world. I believe that some of the methods used
by hobby yachters to generate power could be scaled up, if modified, to
be compatible with commercial ships; such as solar paneling, wind
turbines, and hydro turbines. I also saw an article recently about the
potential use of Flettner Rotors on such ships. I could probably also
write a couple paragraphs on the use of heat pumps to capture waste heat
and use it for useful stuff like drying clothes or heating crew quarters
more efficiently.
