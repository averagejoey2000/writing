Six Dollars. I came here to dispute an overdue charge on a book I swear
I returned. I have a lot to do today, and it was enough to drag my
daughter with me after church to translate for me, and we still have to
go to the store to get more maseca. Of course, right when the librarian
hands us the paperwork to fill out the official request to remove the
charge, and attest that I put it in the drop box last Sunday, the fire
alarm goes off. This blaring is giving me such a headache. As I walk out
of the lobby and into the courtyard, I push through a group of confused
Korean women in green blazers. That's weird. I pinch the bridge of my
nose, as sounds mix together; the alarm, the siren of an approaching
fire truck, and... people laughing and setting up a group photo? I cover
my granddaughter's ears at the cost of my own. There's not even any
smoke coming from the building, was it practice? I could come back on
Wednesday, but I have my doctor taking my blood, the fee will have gone
up to ten dollars, and my daughter is working so I have to take care of
the girl and I won't have a translator. I sit by the fountain, take an
aspirin from my purse, my phone from my bra, and make a call. Que
Carajo.

"Photo ID?"

"Right Here, but it's from out of state"

"Did you just move here?"\
"Kinda, I actually go to school at Touro, I live in the dorm, and I
haven't changed my official residence."

"Do you have any mail addressed to you?"\
She's making this kinda difficult.

"No Yeah, I don't, but my school ID has the address on the back"\
"And this address is where we can send you mail?"\
"Actually, students have a mailroom box with a different address"
