	abstract = {The automatic identification system ({AIS}) is an essential and economical equipment for collision avoidance and maritime surveillance. However, {AIS} can be subject to intentional reporting of false information, or “spoofing”. This article assumes the vessel trajectory nominally follows a piecewise mean-reverting process; thereby, it addresses the problem of establishing whether a vessel is reporting adulterated position information through {AIS} messages in order to hide its current planned route and a possible deviation from the nominal route. Multiple hypothesis testing suggests a framework to enlist reliable information from monitoring systems (coastal radars and space-born satellite sensors) in support of detection of anomalies, spoofing, and stealth deviations. The proposed solution involves the derivation of anomaly detection rules based on the generalized likelihood ratio test and the model-order selection methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection strategy is tested for different case studies within an operational scenario with simulated data.},

	abstract = {The Automatic Identification System ({AIS}) is a self-reporting system based on {VHF} radio to transmit a vessel’s identity,
position, speed, heading and other parameters to improve maritime domain awareness. However, {AIS} information can be
programmatically spoofed by terrorists or other criminals, who often choose to masquerade as innocent civilians and
exploit the vulnerabilities of military and civilian infrastructures for their purposes. Therefore, detecting and localizing a
spoofing {AIS} ship become a critical and challenging issue for maritime security. This paper presents an algorithm to
detect and geolocalize a spoofing {AIS} emitter using space-based {AIS} signals with its Doppler frequency. With an {AIS}
signal sensor on a fast orbiting satellite, the measured {AIS} Doppler frequency of an {AIS} emitter can be used to define a
double-napped cone of which the satellite is at its vertex and satellite velocity coincides with its axis, such that the
theoretical Doppler frequency derived from the radial velocity to the {AIS} emitter matches the measured Doppler
frequency. All such matches can only lie on either cone extending out from the satellite, which cuts the Earth’s surface
in two curves, so we know that the {AIS} emitter must lie somewhere on these curves. Two such {AIS} Doppler frequency
measurements for the same stationary {AIS} emitter produce two valid curves which intersect at the position of the {AIS}
emitter. Multiple Doppler frequency measurements can be used to better estimate the position fix of an {AIS} emitter,
hence determine the spoofing {AIS} ship if the estimated position fix unreasonably differs from the position carried in its
{AIS} message. A set of formulas are derived which relate an {AIS} emitter position to its Doppler frequency measurements.},

	abstract = {Automatic Identification Systems ({AIS}) are transponder systems installed on marine vessels which transmit the location, speed and other vessel details. These signals are received by shore side {AIS} Base stations. The use of {AIS} is mandatory under international {SOLAS} regulations for certain categories of vessels. {AIS} is used to monitor for pollution, search and rescue ({SAR}) and illegal fishing activity. Some vessel operators deliberately interfere with their {AIS} transponders, including spoofing their real position or switching their {AIS} transponder to low transmit power, to reduce the likelihood of being detected but still being in compliance with {SOLAS} regulations. This might suggest that they are involved in nefarious activity. This paper presents a technique to detect vessels which are switching their Class-A, {AIS} transponders from normal transmit power to low transmit power mode, by utilising the Received Signal strength Indicator field ({RSSI}) that the receiving Base Station tags incoming {AIS} messages with. The technique presented, analyses received {RSSI} in combination with predicted {RSSI} values via mathematical modelling and presents a unique detection algorithm. Data from the Irish National {AIS} was used for the study. Although only a small amount of testing was carried out, results showed that for a test vessel which switched its transponder to low power transmit mode, it was found that a specific drop in {RSSI} of approximately 10 {dBm} (decibel-milliwatts) was detectable for different distances from the receiving base station.},

While previous research has proposed strategies to detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the time-division multiple access ({TDMA}) communication protocol. In this work, the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects {TDMA} protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time. Source codes of the method are open-source to foster research activities from both industry and academia in this field.},

It is well known that automated identification system ({AIS}) spoofing can be used for electronic warfare to conceal military activities in sensitive sea areas; however, recent events suggest that there is a similar interest of spoofing {AIS} signals for commercial purposes. The shipping industry is currently experiencing an unprecedented period of deceptive practices by tanker operators seeking to evade sanctions. Last year’s announcement of a price cap on Russian crude oil and a new ban on Western companies insuring Russian cargoes is setting the stage for an increase in illegal activity. Our research team identified and documented the {AIS} position falsification by tankers transporting Russian crude oil in closed ship-to-ship ({STS}) oil transfers. The identification of the falsified positions is based on the repeated instances of discrepancies between {AIS} location suggestions and satellite radar imagery indications. Using the data methods at our disposal, we reconstructed the true movements of certain tankers and encountered some surprising behavior. These false ship positions make it clear that we need effective tools and strategies to ensure the reliability and robustness of {AISs}.},

The reports contain information on the vessel position, velocity etc. and typically have high accuracy. Given that the {AIS} is a self-reporting system, the trustworthiness of positional information depends on data being reported by the vessel, rather than measured by a sensor. Any self-reporting system is prone to "spoofing" or the intentional reporting on incorrect information. This paper addresses the inference problem of whether the received {AIS} data are trustworthy with the help of radar measurements and information from the tracking system. This problem can be treated in the hypothesis testing framework where the null hypothesis is that the {AIS} data are trustworthy and the alternative hypothesis is that the data are spoofed. The proposed solution, the generalized version of the sequential log-likelihood ratio test, is compared to the ideally optimal solution using real and simulated data.},

	abstract = {Since 2002, hundreds of thousands of vessels have equipped the Automatic Identification System ({AIS}), which continuously broadcasts its identity and location information for vessel collision avoidance. To utilize these scattered {AIS} data for further analysis, there are multiple {AIS} data platforms collecting {AIS} data from vessels around the world through their satellites and land-based stations. Thus, users can obtain {AIS} data of vessels from these platforms without dedicated devices. However, existing platforms work in silos, and {AIS} data is distributed across different platforms, resulting in reduced data availability. In addition, {AIS} is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks, which can undermine the authenticity of {AIS} data. In this paper, we propose {AISChain}, a secure and fast blockchain-based {AIS} data platform. {AISChain} adopts consortium blockchain, which only permits those authorized parties (i.e., {AIS} data providers) to participate in the consensus protocol, and is compatible with current commodity {AIS} hardware. Since the whole system is co-maintained by multiple authorized parties, {AISChain} can integrate {AIS} data resources in a secure way. For avoiding repeated recording of {AIS} data on the chain, we design the Dynamic Bloom Filter Tree ({DBFT}) to realize efficient duplication detection in the transaction verification phase. We also propose the dual signature scheme to clarify the {AIS} data ownership. Moreover, we leverage the geographical location-based blockchain sharding approach to further improve the scalability of {AISChain}. We implement a prototype of {AISChain}, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of {AISChain}. Evaluation results show that the search time of {DBFT} is negligible (4.3 ms) with an extreme low error ratio (0.4\%). Meanwhile, {AISChain} can achieve more than 730 tx/s throughput even when nodes scale to 36. To the best of our knowledge, {AISChain} is the first work to apply the blockchain technology to secure the {AIS} data platform.},

Maritime traffic is annually increasing in volume, and with it the number of anomalous events that might be of interest to law enforcement agencies, governments, and militaries. This work proposes a data fusion pipeline that uses a mixture of artificial intelligence and traditional algorithms to identify ships at sea and classify their behavior. A fusion process of visual spectrum satellite imagery and automatic identification system ({AIS}) data was used to identify ships. Further, this fused data was further integrated with additional information about the ship's environment to help classify each ship's behavior to a meaningful degree. This type of contextual information included things such as exclusive economic zone boundaries, locations of pipelines and undersea cables, and the local weather. Behaviors such as illegal fishing, trans-shipment, and spoofing are identified by the framework using freely or cheaply accessible data from places such as Google Earth, the United States Coast Guard, etc. The pipeline is the first of its kind to go beyond the typical ship identification process to help aid analysts in identifying tangible behaviors and reducing the human workload.},

Spoofed {AIS} messages have the potential to interfere with the safe navigation of a vessel by, amongst other approaches, spoofing maritime virtual aids to navigation and/or differential global navigation satellite system ({DGNSS}) correction data conveyed across it. Acting maliciously, a single transmitter may spoof thousands of {AIS} messages per minute with the potential to cause considerable nuisance; compromising information provided by {AIS} intended to enhance the mariner's situational awareness. This work describes an approach to authenticate {AIS} messages using public key cryptography ({PKC}) and thus provide unequivocal evidence that {AIS} messages originate from genuine sources and so can be trusted. Improvements to the proposed {AIS} authentication scheme are identified which address a security weakness and help avoid false positives to spoofing caused by changes to message syntax. A channel loading investigation concludes that sufficient bandwidth is available to routinely authenticate all {AIS} messages whilst retaining backwards compatibility by carrying {PKC} ‘digital signatures’ in a separate {VHF} Data Exchange System ({VDES}) side channel.},

This paper presents Protected {AIS} ({pAIS}), a demonstration of capability implementation using public-key cryptography methods to address several {AIS} security vulnerabilities, maintain backward compatibility, and be able to interoperate with non-{pAIS} devices.},

	abstract = {This paper takes a close look at the landscape of the Automatic Identification System ({AIS}) as a major source of information for maritime situational awareness ({MSA}) and identifies its vulnerabilities and challenges for safe navigation and shipping. As an important subset of cyber threats affecting many maritime systems, the {AIS} is subject to problems of tampering and reliability; indeed, the messages received may be inadvertently false, jammed, or intentionally spoofed. A systematic literature review was conducted for this article, complemented by a case study of a specific spoofing event near Elba in December 2019, which confirmed that the typical maritime {AIS} could be easily spoofed and generate erroneous position information. This intentional spoofing has affected navigation in international waters and passage through territorial waters. The maritime industry is neither immune to cyberattacks nor fully prepared for the risks associated with the use of modern digital systems. Maintaining seaworthiness in the face of the impact of digital technologies requires a robust cybersecurity framework.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the interest of analyzing {GNSS} (Global Navigation Satellite System) and {AIS} (Automatic Id entification System) data to improve the safety of naval infrastructures for a wide spectrum of maritime applications. However, in-depth analyses also underline the sensitivity of these systems to attacks such as jamming and spoofing. In this context, it is essential that researchers, specialized organizations and companies rely on realistic data to improve these types of systems to better detect and cope with potential threats. However, because of the lack of open data sets, or due to financial, technical or operational reasons, the use of simulated data is preferred in most cases over real life data, which can lead to biases. To cope with this challenge, we have developed a prototype called “{HAPPINESS}” for “Holistic {APProach} of Integrated Navigation Equipment for Cybersecurity at Sea”. The main objective of this dedicated and autonomous embedded system is to collect navigation data in real time without using proprietary or restrictive protocols. The generated open data, then continuously feeds a cyber naval platform able to reproduce the functional and operational systems of a ship. This prototype allows to reproduce the kinematics of a ship in various contexts (like specific maneuvers, long tracks, docking…) in {NMEA} format in order to design highly realistic scenarios based on real life data and allowing to obtain more complete and richer data (than those freely accessible online) in terms of information, giving additional means to detect anomalies on navigation systems.},

	abstract = {The development of contemporary navigation and positioning systems have significantly improved reliability and speeds in maritime navigation. At the same time, the vulnerabilities of these systems to cyber threats represent a remarkable issue to the safety of navigation. Therefore, the maritime community has raised the question of cybersecurity of navigation systems in recent years. This paper aims to analyse the vulnerabilities of the Global Navigation Satellite System ({GNSS}), Electronic Chart Display Information System ({ECDIS}) and Automatic Identification System ({AIS}). The concepts of these systems were developed at a time when cybersecurity issues have not been among the  top priorities. Open broadcasts, the absence of or limited existence of data encryption and authentication can be considered as their primary security weaknesses. Therefore, these systems are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The {GPS} as the data source of a ship’s position can relatively easily be jammed and/or spoofed, increasing the vulnerabilities of {ECDIS} and {AIS}. A systematic literature review was conducted for this article, supplemented by a {SWOT} analysis of the {AIS} service and particular case studies of recent cyber-attacks on these systems. The analysis of selected case studies confirmed that these systems could easily be spoofed and become a subject of data manipulation with significant consequences for the safety of navigation. The paper provides conclusions and recommendations highlighting the necessity for the users to be aware of the vulnerabilities of modern navigation systems.},
