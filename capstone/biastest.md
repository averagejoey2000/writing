1.  I strongly feel that nobody should have any gender, therefore
    division of labor between sexes is dumb.

2.  I'm very surprised that I got even a moderate traditional
    association. I kept messing up the home and career options because
    in my mind office is a home word and wedding is a career word. I
    didn't expect my expected result.

3.  I should hope none of them, but I may assign lighter workloads to
    women based on my test results.

4.  Let people pick their own tasks off the board and having metrics in
    place to make sure that I don't pick favorites with assignments.

5.  Transgender

6.  As a genderqueer person, I probably will feel closer to other trans
    people on the ship, and I may treat them more favorably.

7.  Honestly, I think I am just not going to try to be more fair, their
    lives are hard enough.
