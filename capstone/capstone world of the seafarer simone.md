1)  Synopsis

> The chapter explains at length the social positions and duties of the
> seafarers on the ship from the messman to the captain. Time is the
> most limited resource on the ship, so the greatest amount of time and
> effort is devoted to working; shore time is very limited,
> socialization aboard the ship is formalized and off the ship is
> sometimes impossible, opportunities for diversion aboard are finite,
> and the work itself is exhausting as the owners gain a greater profit
> for hiring the mathematically fewest number of people. There is a gulf
> of power between the ratings and the officers, and a similar gorge
> between the junior officers and senior officers, leading to well
> demarcated striations in socialization, always with the implicit
> understanding that all friendship and collusion must be the first
> thing to go when an emergency strikes the ship. The camaraderie
> between the Master and the Chief Engineer is important to the smooth
> and happy operation of the ship, but always the captain has the final
> say in all matters concerning the ship's safety, as shown in the
> incident with the air conditioning and the watertight doors. The
> watches too divide the crew. With the day split into thirds, a mate
> like me may only ever say a word to the mate I relieve, the mate that
> relieves me, the engineer who is off at the same time as me, and
> perhaps a handful of A/Bs at breakfast. The social bubble of the ship
> is already small, but the specter of scheduling keeps someone from
> ever spending time with half of that bubble. Some holidays and other
> planned social events may encourage bonding, but the job always takes
> priority, so the bar and the bar-b-que have also been banned from many
> ships.

2)  Reaction

> I didn't have a strong reaction to anything said in the paper, except
> perhaps the thought that I am not used to the admiralty language used
> to describe the titles of the positions and officers. Calling the
> mates the chief officer, second officer, and third officer as opposed
> to chief mate, second mate, and third mate is different from the
> American vernacular; describing the first assistant engineer the
> "second engineer"; and calling the unlicensed crew "ratings" is also
> different. However, this is not new to me, the Filipinos I sailed with
> use the same language, so I assume that this is just how most of the
> world talks, and we Americans are the strange ones. It is a little
> unusual to have explained to me in language for a landsman the details
> of the life I have lived and will live, like a penguin listening to a
> zookeeper give a presentation about Antarctica.
>
> The idea that nothing is more important to the job and that one's
> identity is entirely replaced by their job description is a part of
> what entices me to the sea. I was raised to not value the difference
> between people, and to be wholly ignorant of color and creed. My
> sincerest hope is that upon my graduation and licensure, I can leave
> behind all aspects of my identity except my job. To not be seen as a
> queer, an Asian, a nonbinary person, a neurodivergent person; that I
> would only ever be seen as the 3^rd^ mate. Page 95, however, reduces
> that hope for me, as some of the old guard still choose to
> discriminate and bully on such grounds.

3)  Questions

    a.  What are some possible solutions to reduce the loneliness and
        boredom on ships?

    b.  How can the social hierarchy be reduced in steepness without
        compromising vessel safety?

    c.  How can the pressures be made easier to bear for minorities?
        Want solutions from the perspectives of junior officers, senior
        officers, companies, and governments.
